      so that the data cannot be re-identified to specific individuals, nor can
      it be recovered. In accordance with the applicable laws and regulations,
      such processed data can be used without separately notifying you or
      obtaining your consent.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>II. How We Store and Protect Your Personal Information</p>
    <p>1. How we store your personal information</p>
    <p>
      The personal information collected with your consent will be stored in
      accordance with the laws and regulations on the personal privacy data
      protection of the countries concerned. To the extent not prohibited by
      local laws and regulations, we may also store the collected personal
      information in countries or regions outside the country where the business
      is located.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, Game SDK may store your personal information in: India,
      Ireland.
    </p>
    <p>In particular:</p>
    <p>
      The personal information collected and generated during our operations in
      India will be stored on servers located in India.
    </p>
    <p>
      The personal information collected and generated in our business outside
      India will be stored on servers in Ireland.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to business conditions, we may use servers in other regions or
      countries in the future, and we will update this Policy at that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether we store personal information in the country where the business is
      located, or in other countries or regions to the extent that doing so does
      not violate laws and regulations, we will retain it in accordance with the
      relevant laws and regulations on data storage. At the same time, we will
      consider the characteristics, scope and purpose of personal information
      processing, the risks that may be encountered in the processing, and the
      serious consequences caused by the damage, etc., and implement the
      necessary security measures. For example, we will use encryption and
      de-identification methods to store the personal information collected. We
      will also keep the information for the shortest storage period specified
      by law. For those not specified by law, we will retain the information
      according to the shortest storage period required for business. For data
      that exceeds the storage period, or data that you request us to delete, we
      will delete said data accordingly or take other appropriate measures
      without violating the relevant laws and regulations.
    </p>
    <p>2. How we protect your personal information</p>
    <p>
      We will take other necessary measures to protect the security of your
      personal information and prevent data from being misused, unauthorized
      access, and unauthorized modification, disclosure or destruction, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      We implement security safeguards designed to protect your personal
      information and regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities
      and attacks, and we use administrative, technical, and physical safeguards
      to protect your personal information by taking the types of the personal
      information, the processing, and the threats posed themselves into
      account. We are constantly working to improve on these safeguards to keep
      your personal data secure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, we need to remind you that no matter how perfect the
      measures are, there is no absolute guarantee of avoiding the occurrence of
      data storage security incidents. If a data breach event occurs, we will
      report it to the corresponding regulatory authorities as required by the
      relevant laws and regulations, and provide the type of personal data
      involved in the breach, the number of data subjects, the possible
      consequences of the breach, and the remedial measures we intend to take
      according to the requirements of the regulatory authorities. We will take
      the best possible measures to remedy or mitigate the damage and
      consequences of data breach. When permitted or required by laws and
      regulations, we will inform you of the possible consequences or
      significant damage to you in a timely manner, so that you can take
      appropriate measures promptly to protect your rights as much as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no absolutely safe website, Internet transmission, computer
      system and wireless connections. In addition to the necessary protective
      measures we have taken, users have to strengthen the awareness of privacy
      security risks. For example, when you access third-party websites, links,
      products or services from our services, for the security of any data
      collected by those websites, links, products or services, please read
      through the terms and conditions of those third-parties carefully. We do
      not take any legal responsibility for data security issues caused by such
      third parties. If you find that certain contents, advertisements or
      features in our websites, products or services may be provided by a third
      party and may possibly endanger your privacy and security, please contact
      us promptly, as we will handle it with priority in accordance with laws
      and regulations.

    <p>III. How We Share, Transfer and Disclose Your Personal Information</p>
    <p>
      When sharing, transferring, and disclosing your personal information, we
      uphold the principles and requirements of minimization, necessity, and
      legality. Under normal circumstances, we do not share, transfer or
      disclose your personal information externally. However, to the extent
      permitted by applicable laws and regulations, we may share, transfer and
      disclose your personal information in the following situations:
    </p>
    <p>1. How we share your personal information</p>
    <p>
      We do not sell any personal information to third parties. In order to
      provide you with timely services, your personal information may be shared
      with Game SDK affiliated companies. We will only share your information
      within Game SDK affiliated companies for legitimate and explicit purposes,

    <p>
      We may share the necessary personal information with authorized
      third-party partners (including technical service providers and data
      storage service providers etc.) for the performance of certain features or
      to provide you with better service and a better user experience. For
      example, in order to enable you to share information to third party
      platforms, use location service and other kinds of services and features,
      we may embed third party SDK or other similar applications of authorized
      partners in this Application. We uphold the principles of minimization,
      necessity, and legality to carry out such sharing. Before sharing
      information, we will sign strict confidentiality agreements with
      authorized partners and require them to take relevant confidentiality and
      security measures to process personal information in accordance with this
      Policy and applicable laws in your jurisdiction. In addition, we will also
      require them to provide data security capabilities and information
      security qualifications (e.g., grade protection assessment, information
      security management system). When we embed the third party SDK or other
      similar applications of authorized partners in this Application, we will
      notify you promptly and request the SDK service provider that obtains the
      information to protect your data security.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to provide evaluation, analysis or other business services, we
      may also share your non-personal information with third parties. For
      example, we may use aggregated data to help partners (e.g., game
      operators) understand the effectiveness, feedback and usage trends of
      their services.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the event of a merger, acquisition or bankruptcy liquidation, asset
      transfer and other related transaction, if a personal information transfer
      is involved, we will require the new entity or organization holding your
      personal information to continue to be bound by this Policy through an
      agreement or other appropriate measures, and we will require such subject
      to take confidentiality and security measures of a degree no less than the
      requirements of this Policy to process personal information.
    </p>
    <p>2. How we transfer your personal information</p>

      issue a prominent notice via email and/or on our website or other
      appropriate methods to inform you of any changes in the ownership and your
      rights of your personal information, and any choices you may have about
      your personal information.
    </p>
    <p>

      you by other means.
    </p>
    <p>3. How we disclose your personal information</p>
    <p>
      According to the legal requirements, legal procedures, litigation and/or
      requests from government departments and authorities, Game SDK may be
      required to disclose your personal information. If the disclosure is
      necessary or appropriate for national security, law enforcement, or other
      matters of public importance, we may also disclose information about you.
    </p>
    <p>Additionally, we may share your personal information with:</p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>IV. How Your Personal Information is Transferred Across Borders</p>
    <p>
      For the purposes described in this Policy, and to the extent permitted by
      applicable local laws and regulations and with your authorized consent, we
      may transfer your personal information to the resources or servers
      stipulated in section III of this Policy for storage or processing, we may
      also transfer your personal information to third-party service providers
      and business partners and your data may therefore also be transmitted to
      other countries or regions. The privacy protection laws of these countries
      or regions may be different, and the jurisdiction in which these global
      resources or servers are located may or may not protect personal
      information to the same standards as in your jurisdiction. However, we
      will still strive to comply with our Privacy Policy to protect your
      personal information, and we will follow the legal requirements of the
      country or region where the personal information is located to carry out
      the corresponding cross-border transfer and other processing of personal
      information.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the circumstance that we transfer personal information outside of your
      jurisdiction, whether it transferred to our affiliates or third-party
      service providers, we will comply with relevant applicable laws. We will
      take appropriate security measures and safeguards to make sure that all
      such transfers meet the requirements of applicable local data protection
      laws.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>V. Your Rights to Your Personal Information</p>
    <p>
      As a data subject, you have a series of rights to your personal
      information, including the right to confirm, access, correct, delete,
      withdraw consent, and lodge complaints (hereinafter referred to as
      “request”). We fully understand and respect your rights, and
      such rights will be subject to specific exclusions and exceptions under
      applicable laws. We will also take active steps to ensure that your rights
      are effectively protected. However, please understand and note that for
      security reasons, we may need to verify your identity before processing
      your request. In principle, we do not charge a fee for your lawful and
      reasonable request, but we will charge a certain reasonable fee for
      repeated requests that exceed the reasonable limit where applicable, and
      based on actual administrative costs permitted by the applicable laws. We
      may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require excessive
      technical means (for example, to develop new systems or fundamentally
      change existing practices), pose risks to the legal rights of others or
      are extremely impractical, or violate the mandatory provisions by law.
    </p>
    <p>1. Right to confirm and access</p>
    <p>
      We inform you how we collect and process personal information through this
      Policy or in the form of a privacy policy or notice of the specific
      product or service. You have the right to confirm or reject such
      collection and processing via a check box or other methods. However, after
      you reject, some features that require your explicit authorization and
      consent to use may no longer be available. You can directly access the
      personal information you have provided to us in the interface of our
      products or services. For those that you are unable to access, you can
      send an email to jiuke175375@163.com. We will handle it promptly
      after receiving your email.
    </p>
    <p>2. Right to correct and delete</p>
    <p>
      When your personal information is changed, or when you find that your
      personal information collected and processed by us is inaccurate or
      incomplete, you have the right to ask us to make corrections or additions.
      You can directly correct or modify some of your personal information on
      the relevant product/service function pages. When your personal
      information collected by us has fulfilled the purpose of collection or is
      no longer required, or when you find that our collection and processing of
      your personal information violates the provisions of laws and regulations
      or this Privacy Policy, you have the right to ask us to delete the
      relevant personal information. For personal information that we have not
      provided you with a channel for correction or deletion, you can request
      that it be corrected or deleted by contacting
      jiuke175375@163.com.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, we may not grant your deleting request in some situations, for
      example, if you ask us to delete your transaction data when Game SDK are
      legally obligated to keep a record of that transaction to comply with the
      applicable local law. Please also kindly note that if you request to
      delete your information from our products and services, we may not remove
      the corresponding information from the backup system immediately due to
      some applicable local laws and technological limitations, however, we will
      securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further
      processing until the backup is updating or can be deleted or be made
      anonymous.
    </p>
    <p>3. Right to withdraw consent</p>
    <p>
      To achieve the respective features of our various products or services, we
      will require necessary personal information in accordance with the
      applicable local laws. This is described in the "How We Collect and Use
      Your Personal Information" part of this Policy. When our data processing
      activities are premised on your consent, you may withdraw your consent
      previously granted to us for a specific purpose by deleting information,
      turning off device features, and requesting to withdraw consent, including
      the collection, use and/or disclosure of your personal information that we
      manage or control. You can email us at jiuke175375@163.com for
      above operations. We will process your request within a reasonable time
      after you send the request, and thereafter will not collect, use and/or
      disclose your personal information in accordance with your request.
    </p>
    <p>
